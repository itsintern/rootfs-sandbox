rootfs-sandbox
==============

An Openembedded rootfs-sandbox intended for use with the 
meta-toolchain SDK tarball provided with a OE based distro.

Use PMS to install/remove individual packages, and manually 
create an image of your choice when done.
Use PMS to expand your target or nativesdk sysroots, if you
are missing libcurl when cross-compiling, simply add it 
with rootfs-sandbox.
